## Debian

The stock Debian package generated by the Tauri bundler has everything you need to ship your application to Debian-based Linux distributions, defining your application's icons, generating a Desktop file, and specifying the dependencies `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37` and `libgtk-3-0`, along with `libappindicator3-1` if your app uses the system tray.

### Custom Files

Tauri exposes a few configurations for the Debian package in case you need more control.

If your app depends on additional system dependencies you can specify them in `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > deb`.

To include custom files in the Debian package, you can provide a list of files or folders in `tauri.conf.json > bundle > linux > deb > files`. The configuration object maps the path in the Debian package to the path to the file on your filesystem, relative to the `tauri.conf.json` file. Here's an example configuration:

```json
{
  // ... other configurations 
  "bundle": {
    "active": true,
    "targets": "all",
    "icon": [
      "icons/32x32.png",
      "icons/128x128.png",
      "icons/128x128@2x.png",
      "icons/icon.icns",
      "icons/icon.ico"
    ],
    "linux": {
      //... all linux related configurations go here 
      "deb": {
        "files": {} //The files to include on the package.
      },
    }
  }
}

```
